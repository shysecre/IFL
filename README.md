### IFL (I F#cking lazy)

IFL - is a program build with electron & react with redux.

Main goal of this project is to help you be more productive with adding new songs to your spotify playlists :)

How it works?
- Download latest release. Install it. Login with your spotify account.
- Now you need to choose one or any amount of PUBLIC playlists you have.
- Simple add keybind to your chosen playlist & enjoy music!
- Press keybind when you hear song that touches you really deep and boom song will jump into your playlist.
